This project concerns the development of an AI based chatbot for an educational institute called ASTRO-Edu College. The role of the chatbot here is to act as a virtual counselor and provide answers to queries that customers ask about subjects of ASTRO-Edu College. The Chatbot will be added to the website of the ASTRO-Edu College. It is intended to replace a human counsellor on private sector education. Potential students of the institute could ask questions relating to courses, subjects, lecturers and other relevant issues. The chatbot will provide both short answers and where necessary lengthy explanations. The chatbot will work day and night 24/7 providing information to user queries. One important feature of this Chatbot is its ability to learn things via user interaction. This is called machine learning. This allows users to train the Bot to expand its knowledge base. The chatbot is also capable of engaging in small talk such as “Hello”,” Hi” and “Good morning”. However, any meaningful conversation is limited to services of ASTRO-Edu College only.
